# FantasyFootball

Working on a side project that will analyze NFL Player rankings for fantasy football drafts. Goal will be to scrape ADP ranking data from multiple sources as well as project fantasy points by week or season. Then optimize to best available player based on your position in the draft, current roster, value, and projected points.
